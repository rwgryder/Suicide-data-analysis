# Suicide-data-analysis

Suicide data from the United Nations, World Bank, and World Health Organization is analyzed to investigate the relationship between suicide rates and GDP while accounting for various demographics. Analysis techniques include Logistic regression, Gamma regression, and Mixed Effects models. SQL database connectivity in R is used for efficient computations. The R markdown file (.Rmd) produces an HTML file containing the full analysis. The HTML file can be downloaded then opened (too large to view on GitHub).
